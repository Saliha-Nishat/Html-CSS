<h1>ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE</h1>
<p1>
Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence by machines, particularly computer systems. It involves creating algorithms that enable machines to perform tasks typically requiring human intelligence, such as learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and language understanding.<br> AI is categorized into several types:

Narrow AI: Focused on specific tasks, like recommendation systems or speech recognition.
General AI: Aims to perform any intellectual task that a human can do (still theoretical).
Machine Learning (ML): A subset of AI that focuses on algorithms that learn and improve from data without explicit programming.
Deep Learning: A specialized ML approach using neural networks to analyze large, unstructured data sets.</p1>
<h1>Datasciences</h1>
<p1>Data Science is a multidisciplinary field that combines statistical methods, algorithms, and technology to extract meaningful insights and knowledge from data. It involves various stages, including data collection, cleaning, exploration, analysis, and visualization. Data Science uses tools from statistics, mathematics, and computer science, <br>along with domain expertise, to address complex problems.

Core components of Data Science include:

Data Analysis: Identifying patterns and trends.
Data Visualization: Representing data insights graphically.
Machine Learning: Predictive modeling using data.
Big Data: Handling and analyzing large-scale datasets.
Data Science powers applications in business analytics, scientific research, fraud detection, and personalization engines, making it integral to decision-making in many sectors.</p1>
